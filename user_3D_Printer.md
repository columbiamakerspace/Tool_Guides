# 3D Printer - User Guide #

Once you have been trained on this tool, you should be able to: 

- Import an STL file into Cura and export a G-code file with the appropriate settings for the printer. 
- Change materials
- Start a print and cancel it in case of failure
- Abide by all of the safety policies and material usage rules.

### Importing an STL file ###
First, you will need a 3D mesh model in the STL file format. Most CAD software should have an option to export an STL file. You can also download publicly available files from websites such as [Thingiverse](www.thingiverse.com). 

Next, launch the [Cura](ADD LINK HERE) application and open the STL file, either by dragging-and-dropping or through the `File â†’ Open` menu interface. You should now see a preview of how the model will appear once printed. You can navigate within this preview using the following gestures:

- Right click and drag to *Orbit*
- Hold `Shift`, then right click and drag to *Pan*
- Scroll to *Zoom*
