# 3D Printer - User Guide #
*Updated June 3, 2017*

Once you have been trained on this tool, you should be able to: 

- Import an STL file into Cura and export a G-code file with the appropriate settings for the printer. 
- Change materials.
- Start a print and cancel it in case of failure
- Abide by all of the safety policies and material usage rules.

## Introduction ##


## Cura ##
### Importing an STL file ###
First, you will need a 3D mesh model in the STL file format. Most CAD software should have an option to export an STL file. You can also download publicly available files from websites such as [Thingiverse](www.thingiverse.com). 

Next, launch the [Cura](ADD LINK HERE) application and open the STL file, either by dragging-and-dropping or through the `File` → `Open` menu interface. You should now see a preview of how the model will appear once printed. You can navigate within this preview using the following gestures:

- Right click and drag to *Orbit*
- Hold `Shift`, then right click and drag to *Pan*
- Scroll to *Zoom*

### Print settings ###
##### Printer 
Select either the *Ultimaker 2 Extended+* or the *Ultimaker 3 Extended*, as appropriate. 

##### Nozzle & Material
You will need to select the correct nozzle size to ensure that the printer will extrude plastic at the correct rate. All of our Ultimaker 2 printers use a **0.6 mm** nozzle, whereas all of our Ultimaker 3 printers use a **0.4 mm** nozzle. 

We recommend using Polylactic Acid (**PLA**) thermoplastic for the vast majority of 3D printing applications because of its ease-of-use and reliability. 
Please seek advice from a superuser before attempting to use any type of material other than PLA.

## Changing Material ##
On the Ultimaker, navigate to `Material` → `Change`. Follow the directions on the screen to remove the previous material and insert the new material. When removing a spool from the back of the printer, you will need to squeeze the two tabs of the spool holder together in order to allow the spool to slide off. Be sure select the correct material type on-screen at the end of the process. 

When possible, please use material spools that have already been opened before opening a new box. This helps us keep track of our inventory and reduce waste.
